# Utilizing-Environmental-Factors-to-Predict-Vaccine-Acceptance

· Visualized distribution of variable through histogram and bar plot, and transformed skewed variable using log

· Implemented various tuned models to predict state vaccination acceptance rates and compared mean-squared error; achieved MSE of 5.54 for random forest model is the half of multiple linear regression and K-Nearest Neighbors

· Extracted the top three significant predictors through the MSE of random forest, and investigated predictors’ correlation with exterior reference
